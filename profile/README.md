# The GW Lab

Welcome to our lab!

We study how marine organisms persist in the face of climate change and the increasing threat of infectious disease.
We aim to conduct science that can help make marine ecosystems more resilient, sheds light on their importance, and documents their destruction by anthropogenic climate change.

Feel free to look around.
We primarily use GitHub to store:

* Raw and processed data from field work
* Lab protocols and instructions
* Scripts, notebooks, etc. for processing data
